          Some stories fade with time. Others leave a mark.  
          <strong>Faded Chapter</strong> is for those who carry their past like a shadow—  
          unseen yet ever-present, shaping who they are.

          Faded Chapter is not just a clothing brand—it’s a tribute to the moments that define us.  
          Every piece is a page from an unwritten story, a canvas for memories, a reflection of  
          those who embrace their past without erasing it.  
        </p>
  
        <p class="vision">
          Rooted in vintage aesthetics, our designs blend <strong>distressed textures, faded hues, and timeless silhouettes</strong>  
          to create apparel that speaks to those who live authentically—  
          <strong>unpolished, unfiltered, unapologetically real.</strong>  
        </p>
  
        <p class="closing">
          <strong>Because not all stories need a perfect ending. Some are meant to be carried forward.</strong>
